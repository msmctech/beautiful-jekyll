<p>We've all heard of blockchains and bitcoins, but what's that got to do with broadcast video? In broadcast, we're quietly adopting Artificial Intelligence to help us through production and distribution. And in the last couple of years, there is a building momentum of broadcasters racing to cloud and virtualised solutions. </p>

<p>Yet, nobody is talking about decentralisation. Blockchain technology and the ecosystems they support are innovating at a rapid pace. During the last year, there has been an explosion of DeFi Apps: Decentralised Finance. Looks like every other app on the surface; a whole different world underneath.</p>

<p>Let's explore what this means for the world of media and broadcast. This site is mainly to host a growing collection of articles where I share my thoughts on what the future might be, for discussion.</p>
