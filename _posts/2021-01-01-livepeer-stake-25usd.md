*Update: January 24, 2021: This is working. My original stake is on track for c.10% annual return, and the value of the coins themselves are going up. So, somewhere along the way, my miniscule offering to the world of decentralised transcoding has helped to transcode some video.*

# LivePeer Video Transcoding : Staking

I'm fascinated by how decentralised technologies and their possibilities will change the future of broadcast. This tech is still way out there from wide adoption, at least in the broadcast industry. As always, broadcast can be a bit slow to adopt!

Five years ago, 'cloud' was still an uncertainty. No further comment required. Will it be the same with decentralised tech and blockchain? My guess is a firm yes. So I'm exploring and doing my best to understand.

*Let's cover some disclaimers: I have no affiliation with LivePeer or any other organisation mentioned here. I am definitely no expert on any of this. 
This is certainly not a recommendation of investment or any other form of recommendation. It's just me sharing an experiment because I'm curious, and I hope it might trigger some discussion.*

### What is LivePeer?

According to their website, [livepeer.org:](http://livepeer.org/)

> Livepeer is a decentralized video transcoding network built on the Etherium blockchain

Awesome. What does that mean?

In my very simple understanding, it's an open network that allows anyone 
with some compute power to offer video transcoding services.

I'm not going to go further into what LivePeer do, that's on their website. 
Instead, I'd like to share how I just 'staked' $25 (more or less) with 
one of their 'Orchestrators'.

### But first up, why?

Because I'm curious. And the comes a point where no amount of reading answers 
all the questions. You need to jump in an try it, so I did.

**Am I transcoding video?**

Nope.

I don't have a room full of GPU's waiting for something to do. Not my thing. Interestingly, there's another option which is commonplace across cryptocurrency investing. That's something called *staking*. 

Nothing to do with vampires, it's where you take your crypto, and you loan it in return for interest. Just like banks have been doing with your savings since banks were invented.

## How to Stake $25 on Video Transcoding

Let's not get caught up in the details of blockchains, ERC20 tokens and all that. Good fun, but worryingly, not something you need to know to spend money like this.

This description is not a super-detailed and intricate step by step guide. It is general guidance on how to stake your hard earned cash on video transcoding.

### 1. Get some Ether

Ether (ETH) are the main 'coins' you can buy on the Etherium blockchain. We need to start with these because they are easy to get hold of if you're starting with cold hard cash.

There's a lot of info out there on how to do this. For this exercise, I made use of my [coinbase.com](http://www.coinbase.com/) account. Follow your way around your chosen coin exchange and buy some ETH.

For Coinbase, there are two phone apps: first is the Coinbase app itself, manage your portfolio etc. There is a second app you need for this little adventure, and that's the Coinbase Wallet app. Easy enough: download, connect to the main app. Transfer your ETH into the 'wallet'.

### 2. Connect your 'Wallet' with your Ether in to LivePeer

Next step is to find the LivePeer explorer app. It's here: [https://explorer.livepeer.org](https://www.coinbase.com/join/rawlin_nl)

There is a helpful guide within the app that takes you step by step through staking. I had a little trouble with that, though not sure whether my internet connection was being unhelpful, or the site is a little slow. Nevertheless, the guide is there.

First step here is to connect your 'Wallet' to LivePeer. Depending on which wallet you use, I'm sure 
there are different methods. I simply had to scan a QR code with my phone. Easy.

### 3. Convert (Trade) your Ether for LivePeer Tokens (LPT)

Now we really get into the murky world of Decentralised Apps ([DApps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp)).

Whilst money makes the world go round, LivePeer Tokens (LPT's) make decentralised transcoders go round. To be a little technical, LPT's are ERC-20 tokens running on the Ethereum Blockchain which LivePeer use in their transactions.

If you take a look [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb47d3431018093889bb0f5fa344f7b9fe05b9220e474ec33e47c87bfff3b13ca), you see the public record of my transaction from ETH to LPT. If clicking on the link is too much, here's part of the detail, recorded forever in the blockchain...

### 4. Stake your LPT's with an Orchestrator

Now we have our LTP's in the system, we need to find someone to give them to, i.e. stake them with. We need to choose an Orchestrator.

Simply put, an Orchestrator orchestrates transcoding. And this is where it gets, commercially, quite interesting, and a little confusing. There is a market place of Orchestrators available. We need to choose one. The information displayed includes:

- Fees: the total earned by that orchestrator
- Reward cut & Fee cut: an indication of what share of earnings will be distributed to 'stakers'
- Price per 1T pixels: Transcoding price, not that any of us normally count the number of pixels in our videos.

I went with the Orchestrator that had quite simply earned the most over time as a very rudimentary measure of succes. Click on the Orchestrator of your choice and follow the staking process (very simple).

And when everything has gone through:

With projected earnings of 14% per year on my $26.91, I was quite pleased with myself.

(*I did need to buy some more ETH because there are some fees to pay which need to be covered with ETH in your wallet. That's probably the first two years' profit wiped out!*)

### 5. Sit back and wait

So now I'm earning money from someone else's transcoding. Nice.

## I'd love to know more...

This exercise was not about earning money. Though a part of me hopes! It was about exploring this brave new world of decentralised applications. In particular, far beyond all the promises of the 'cloud', how decentralised technologies could change how we build our content supply chains for the creation and distribution of video in the future.

At this point, I'm a long way from fully understanding the commercial potential of such models. I'd guess that there is potential in:

- Decentralised infrastructure, maybe not owned by the same coorporation, maybe loaned
- ROI through staking
- And even the value of the tokens vs fiat currencies over time (may go up or down)

### It's very early days

What is apparent from data available is that so far, not much has been earned from transcoding. From that I read that not much transcoding has been done. That's ok. I'm sure we are a few years off wider adoption, but the technology is there. And it fascinates me.

I'd love to explore this more, especially where this or equivalent applications are in use, or even just being played with in the broadcast industry. Reach out, and let me know if you actually staked some LPT's!

Happy Transcoding

Mark
