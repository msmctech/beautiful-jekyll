# Writing on Git/Fleek

Some notes to self....

I have site on GitHub, under [https://github.com/msmctech/msmctech.github.io](https://github.com/msmctech/msmctech.github.io)

On my laptop, it's synced under Documents/GitHubRepos/msmctech.gitub.io

Some commands:

- git pull for latest from github
- git status for status
- git branch, to say what branch we're on
    - git branch <new branch name> # to create a new branch
    - git branch -d <branch name> # to delete a branch
- git checkout <branch name> # to switch branches
- git add <file>
- git commit -a -m "message"
- git push

## Writing workflow

1. Write post in Notion
2. Export as .md into /_posts/
3. commit and push

Here's a picture:
